# 🛒 Stationary Shop Management (Java)

A modern, Java-based desktop application to manage a stationery shop’s operations — inspired by the project in [*Object Oriented Programming*](http://dimik.pub/book/588/object-oriented-programming) by [Zohirul Alam Tiemoon](https://github.com/tiemoon).  
📙 Originally written in **C#** — fully reimagined here in **Java** with Object-Oriented Programming best practices.

## 🧾 What’s This Project About?

Running a stationery shop involves handling a lot: products, vendors, daily sales, damaged items, and reports. Doing it all manually wastes time and risks human error.

This software solves those problems by helping the shopkeeper:

✅ Track inventory and stock  
✅ Record product sales and purchases  
✅ Manage damaged goods  
✅ View daily reports  
✅ Monitor vendor payments
